state - Things that keep changing/ dynamic things fall in state rest all are not in it

example consider linkedIn top bar: the things that can be changed for example, notifications messages etc

components - components are pre defined we could say html snippet, the value of which will be from the state

example consider linkedIn top bar the divs and everything the structure basically, which will take i/ps from te state : react will update this

re-rendering - is the process of change of state in the components, this is something react takes care of
